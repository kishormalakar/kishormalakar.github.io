				<h4>About</h4>

				<p>
					I am a civil servant who handles logistics and materials management for the Ministry of Railways,
					Government of India. Indian Railways being a mammoth organization, needs a lot materials to keep its
					operation running. My job is to ensure that the executives responsible for various operations get
					their materials in time without any compromise in quality. My day to day activities include lots of
					interaction with suppliers, contractors, vendors and service providers. I am always keen to solve
					the problems they are facing while dealing with the government so that it gets little easier for
					everyone to do business with the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					My prior experiences also include working as a Sr. Operations Officer for Indian Oil Corporation
					Ltd. It was an wonderful opportunity for professional growth. I used to oversee production of an LPG
					plant and the supply and distribution of LPG cylinders in adjacent markets. Our work was very
					effective and very vital in ensuring the availability of this essential commodity during the
					nationwide lockdown of 2020.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I am not working, I am mostly playing sports or hanging out with friends and colleagues or
					winding down watching some latest movie or TV series. Web development is one area that I have been
					working on since college. My expertise in this area includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySql,
					ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB etc. So time to time, I am also working on various side projects on web
					development. I am also a hobbyist photographer. I keep capturing photos with my phone which you can
					find on my instagram profile.
